# Decked Out
The game of Decked Out was originally created by TangoTek as a Minecraft Minigame, on the HermitCraft server. The hope with posting the idea here is that I would like to see this game recreated as a standalone game. Some of the ideas I came up with to supplement the base concept when making it stand alone:
* Occasional new Content update
  * New Cards, new maps, etc.
* Premium currency
  * Can be obtained through gameplay or purchased
  * Used to purchase card packs
* More Flexible than the MC Minigame
  * Killable enemies
  * Placeable distractions
* Include a Deck Builder
  * Save combos to take on runs
  * Might mean you can't have 1-time-use cards?
* Dungeon Builder?
  * Players could build their own Decked Out dungeons to share with their friends
* Card Fusion?
  * Ability to fuse cards together to try and make more powerful cards
  * Multiple possible outcomes from fusions
* Rogue-like dungeons
  * Have the ability to play through dungeons that are generated pseudo-randomly
  * Leave when reaching a goal spot, or choose to descend deeper for higher risk and higher reward
