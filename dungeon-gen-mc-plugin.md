# Dungeon Generator Minecraft Server Plugin
This plugin would be able to dynamically generate adventureing dungeons. This would include:

* Pre-built dungeon rooms/pieces
  * Saved as Schematics
* different difficulty settings to determine size/complexity
* users can build their own dungeon rooms/pieces
* maze generator that would allow for loops/large rooms
* "puzzle builder" - like Portal 2 puzzle builder, connecting inputs like buttons/levers to outputs like dispensers/disappearing floors
* Possibly a new schematic format to allow for position based triggers or "wireless redstone" for the puzzle builder
