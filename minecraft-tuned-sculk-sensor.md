# Tuned Sculk Sensor

This idea revolves around the dissatisfaction that some players feel when trying to use the Calibrated Sculk Sensor in Minecraft. The Calibrated Sculk Sensor takes a redstone signal strength as input and only listens for sounds/vibrations that correspond to that particular signal. The main issue is that many different sounds/vibrations can fall into each "category," and not all of them seem to fit together.

With this idea, a Calibrated Sculk Sensor could be tuned to only listen for a specific sound/vibration source. An item would be introduced called a Tuning Fork (no recipe ideas, though in my mind it would include redstone, copper, and amethyst). With the Tuning Fork in hand, a player could right click, and the next sound it hears would be "imprinted" into the Tuning Fork. From there, the player can place the Tuning Fork into a Calibrated Sculk Sensor to force it to only listen for the same recorded sound.
