# Mobile Randomizer Pack Tracker

The goal with this is to recreate the functionality of [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net), but in a cross-platform setup, rather than in WPF. Ideally existing EmoTracker packs would be compatible, with the ultimate goal being the ability to run these trackers on a phone/tablet, to allow for those playing randomizers on-the-go to still keep track of their progress, without needing to pull out a laptop. If done right, this would also allow the app to run on MacOS and Linux as well, allowing for full platform coverage.
