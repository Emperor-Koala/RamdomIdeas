# Librarian Lectern Influence Mod

This idea involves changes to the way librarian villagers in Minecraft 
work. It involves a new trade that any librarian can have when it 
reaches master level. Once at master level, there will be an enchanted 
book trade, but the enchantment(s) it has are dependent on what is in 
the lectern it is tied to. Each type of enchantment will have a cost 
multiplier associated with it, and each enchantment adds cost. So the 
player could create a single villager that sells an enchanted book with 
every enchantment they need for a sword/pickaxe/etc, but it will 
eventually become a very high cost. If the cost would go over 1 stack of 
emeralds, then it would transition to the equivalent number of emerald 
blocks, rounded up. If the cost would go over a stack of emerald blocks, 
the book would no longer be required. If the cost would go over two 
stacks of emerald blocks, the trade is locked out. Normal villager 
mechanics could affect trade prices (such as zombie curing), but each 
kind of enchantment would have a price floor that it cannot go below, 
meaning that it would still be quite expensive.
