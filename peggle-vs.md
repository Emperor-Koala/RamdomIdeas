# Peggle VS

A new way to play the classic Peggleâ„¢! Up to 4 players work cooperatively to clear a single Peggle board, however they are competing for the highest score, highest orange pegs cleared, etc. Each player's balls can interact with one another, meaning you could intentionally bump into someone else's ball to prevent them from getting some pegs. Any pegs a particular player's ball has hit will disappear when their ball leaves play, but they will remain on the field so long as the ball remains in play, meaning you can use other players already hit pegs to perform trick shots to get pegs you want before they disappear.
