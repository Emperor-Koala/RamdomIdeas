# Wynncraft Item Comparrison Mod

This idea revolves around the difficulty of comparring items on the Wynncraft MineCraft Server. The easiest way to compare items is to place them side-by-side in your inventory, then hover over each one, back and forth, trying to compare stats.

I'm proposing a mod that would allow you to hover over an item in your inventory, and compare it to your currently equiped item by holding a key on the keyboard (e.g. Alt). While holding this key, a second Item Information box would appear to the side for the current item.

The only tricky part I can see comes from the weapons, where different classes can use different weapons, but any weapon can be obtained by anyone, though I imagine the way to handle this is to just check the weapon type to the currently held item, and if they are the same, then show the comparrison window.
